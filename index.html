                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I was bitten by the programming bug in Junior year of high school while enrolled in a program at the local tech school. Ever since then I've been studying to prepare myself for my career as a programmer. I didn't quit when my school closed near the completion of my Associate's Degree. In fact, <span id="emphasis"><mark>this resulted in me studying quite a few extra courses compared the average Associate's graduate.</mark></span></p>
                <br>
                <p>I started with an interest in software development that leveraged OOP. As I finished my degree I began to enjoy web development more and more. Currently, I am at a crossroads where I could be pulled down either direction: web dev or software dev. Either way, the skills I've learned have turned me into a well-rounded programmer.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I've worked with a diverse range of technologies while studying for my degree. For C# it was .NET WPF and ASP MVC. I've played a bit with Razor pages as well and XAMPP for backend development. NodeJS and Webpack were utilized for my vue.js projects as well as Bootstrap 4 and jQuery for web development projects. I've begun incorporating Sass compilation for my CSS as well; this entire site is vanilla HTML/JS/CSS(Sass) without any extra libraries.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've always had an eye on game development as well. I worked on small Microsoft XNA projects when that was a thing. I've also created mods for Amnesia: TDD that involved considerable scripting and level design.</p>
