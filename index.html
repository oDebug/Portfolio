                <h1>About</h1>
                <p>I was bit by the programming bug in my Junior year of high school when I was enrolled in a program at the local technical school. Ever since I've been studying and working hard to prepare myself for my career as a programmer. I didn't quit when my school closed when I was near completion of my Associate's Degree. In fact, <span id="emphasis"><mark>this resulted in me studying a lot more courses than the average Associate's graduate.</mark></span></p>
                <br>
                <p>I started with an interest in software development that leveraged OOP. As I finished my degree I began to enjoy web development more and more. I would say I am at a crossroads where I could be pulled down either direction: web dev or software dev. Either way, the skills I've learned have turned me into a well-rounded programmer.</p>

                <h2>Programming</h2>
                <p>I've worked with many technologies while studying for my degree. For C# it was .NET WPF and ASP MVC. Played a bit with Razor pages as well. XAMPP for backend development stuff. NodeJS and Webpack for my vue.js projects as well as Bootstrap 4 and jQuery for my web development projects. I've began to incorporate Sass compilation for my CSS as well. This entire site is vanilla HTML/JS/CSS(Sass) without any extra libraries.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I've always had an eye on game development as well. I've worked on small Microsoft XNA projects back when that was a thing. I've also created mods for Amnesia: TDD that involved a lot of scripting and level design.</p>
